# Possible refactoring list
- box or container with an outline for displayed numbers so it looks more like a screen
- maybe make the screen clear when the next button is pressed after hitting the '=' button?
- what does 'ans' do? eliminate this? or make it functional?
- set maximum number of digits display on screen so there isn't error when it is really long?
- create a way to use the cursor (or left/right arrow) to get to a different position in the number?
