The importance of this project:
    This project taught us a lot about flutter and dart and it's real-world applications

This project has several features including:
    - Basic Arithmetic functions (+, -, *, /)
    - Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, cosh, sinh, csc)
    - Logarithmic Functions (ln, log)
    - Exponential Functions (x^y , x^2, x^3)

Contributions:

    Julianna: x^y and Cosine
    Sarah: Sinh and Binary Log
    Leo: Tan and Square Root
    Kaleab: Natural Log and Cosecant
    Nabou: x^3 and Hyperbolic Cosine
    Alli: sin and x^2
