# Calculator App Design

## Overview
The purpose of this document is to discuss the design of the calculator app, it's system, goals, and constraints. 

## System and Requirements
This app uses dart within the flutter framework.
The app is composed of two parts, the main file and the button file (for creating new buttons on the screen)
### User Stories
We chose an array of functions, including trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic.
- As a user I want to click a button called Sin to append sine to the current equation
- As a user I want to click a button called Cos to append cosine to the current equation
- As a user I want to click a button called Tan to append tangent to the current equation
- As a user I want to click a button called Cosh to append the hyperbolic Cosine to the current equation
- As a user I want to click a button called Sinh to append the hyperbolic Sine to the current equation
- As a user I want to click a button called Csc to append the cosecant to the current equation
- As a user I want to click a button called x<sup>2</sup> to append a square to the current equation
- As a user I want to click a button called x<sup>3</sup> to cube the current equation
- As a user I want to click a button called x<sup>y</sup> to add custom exponentiation to an equation
- As a user I want to click a button called Sqrt to evaluate the square root of an equation
- As a user I want to click a button called Log to append the binary log to the current equation
- As a user I want to click a button called ln to append the natural log to the current equation

## Constraints
We had a major time constraint across all team members.
We were also limited by health problems (aka getting sick)
